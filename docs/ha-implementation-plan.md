# High Availability Implementation Plan

## 1. Infrastructure Setup with Pulumi

Extend your existing Pulumi infrastructure code to create:

### Networking
- VPC spanning multiple AZs
- Public and private subnets in each AZ
- NAT Gateways for outbound traffic from private subnets
- Security groups for each component

### Compute Resources
- Auto Scaling Groups for frontend and backend services
- Launch Templates with your Docker configurations
- Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic

### Database
- Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ deployment
- Read replicas for scaling read operations

### Caching
- Amazon ElastiCache Redis with cluster mode enabled
- Multi-AZ replication groups

### Storage
- S3 buckets for static assets and backups
- EFS for shared file storage if needed

### Containerization
- ECR repositories for your Docker images
- ECS or EKS for container orchestration

## 2. Application Modifications

### Frontend
- Update to use environment variables for backend API endpoints
- Implement retry logic for API calls
- Add circuit breakers to handle backend failures gracefully

### Backend
- Make stateless to allow horizontal scaling
- Implement database connection pooling
- Add health check endpoints
- Implement retry logic for database and Redis operations
- Use distributed session management

### Database
- Implement database migration strategy
- Set up proper indexing for performance
- Configure connection pooling
- Implement backup and restore procedures

## 3. Deployment Pipeline

- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline
- Implement blue/green or canary deployments
- Automate testing in staging environment
- Configure automated rollbacks

## 4. Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- Implement distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray
- Configure log aggregation with CloudWatch Logs
- Set up alerts for critical metrics

## 5. Disaster Recovery

- Regular database backups to S3
- Cross-region replication for critical data
- Documented recovery procedures
- Regular DR drills

## 6. Security

- Implement WAF for the load balancer
- Set up VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper IAM roles and policies

## 7. Cost Optimization

- Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Implement auto-scaling based on demand
- Set up cost allocation tags
- Regular review of unused resources
